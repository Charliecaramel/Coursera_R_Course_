#Control Structures
#1. IF, ELSE statements
#The general format of IF statements are as follows

# if(condition){
#     if commands
#} else{
#     ele commands
#}

#else is optional when there are only 2 possible outcomes, typically we also use elseif for many mroe conditions.

# For Example
#1. with variable specification
x=4
if(x>3){
  y = 0
}else{
  y = 1
}
y
#2. without variaable specification
if(x>3){
  10
}else{
  0
}
